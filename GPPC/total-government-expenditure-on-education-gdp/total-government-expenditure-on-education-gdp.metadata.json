        "This indicator shows the share of a country’s economic output (GDP) that is spent on education. It reflects how much of the national budget is directed toward education relative to the size of the economy.",
        "It includes all government spending at the relevant education level — from central, regional, and local authorities — and covers both current and capital expenditures.",
        "A higher percentage means a larger share of national resources is allocated to education, which may indicate political commitment or policy prioritization. But it doesn’t necessarily mean higher spending per student or better outcomes. Countries with lower GDPs might have high percentages but limited resources in absolute terms.",
        "This indicator is useful for understanding how education fits within the broader picture of government spending and national development. It should be interpreted alongside measures like per-student spending and enrolment rates."

      "descriptionProcessing": "**Historical expenditure data:**\n\nHistorical data in this dataset is based on a wide array of sources, reflecting a comprehensive approach to data collection across different time periods and regions. However, the diverse nature of these sources leads to inconsistencies, as methodologies and data quality vary between sources. For instance, older sources like the League of Nations Statistical Yearbook or Mitchell's 1962 data may use different metrics or collection methods compared to more modern sources like the OECD Education reports or UN surveys. This variance in source material and methodology means that direct comparisons across different years or countries might be challenging, necessitating careful interpretation and cross-reference for accuracy. The dataset serves as a rich historical repository but also underscores the complexities and challenges inherent in compiling and harmonizing historical data from multiple, diverse sources.\n\n**Recent estimates:**\n\nGeneral government expenditure on education (current, capital, and transfers) is expressed as a percentage of GDP. It includes expenditure funded by transfers from international sources to government. General government usually refers to local, regional and central governments.",
